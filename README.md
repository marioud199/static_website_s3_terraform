# Static Website Hosted on Amazon S3 Bucket with Terraform

This Terraform configuration sets up a simple static website hosted on an Amazon S3 bucket. It automates the process of creating the necessary AWS resources for hosting the website.

## Prerequisites

Before using this Terraform configuration, make sure you have the following:

- An AWS account with appropriate permissions to create S3 buckets, IAM roles, and policies.
- Terraform installed on your local machine. You can download it from [terraform.io](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials. You can install and configure it by following the instructions in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html).


## Customization

You can customize the following aspects of the static website:

- **Website Content:** Replace the contents of the `index.html` file in the `website` directory with your own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- **Bucket Configuration:** Modify the `terraform.tfvars` file to adjust settings such as bucket name, website index document, error document, and any other desired configurations.
- **HTTPS Support:** Optionally, configure CloudFront distribution with an SSL certificate for HTTPS support. Update the Terraform configuration accordingly.
